# Sunset

189 BC, a few days after the 4th new moon, on the western bank of the Thương River, near present-day Bắc Giang. Just before sunset, partly cloudy and blustering winds.

A group of about seven men kidnap two young girls from the straw hut that Mỵ Châu had ordered built to house orphans, about a half-day walk north of Cổ Loa capital, near a major military garrison that serves to defend Cổ Loa itself. Mỵ Châu is at a stream that feeds the main river, along with her personal guard Ly, a retired warrior whom they call Cậu (master/uncle), and several other women. One of the older orphans, Đăng, manages to flee the scene of the kidnapping unnoticed and tracks Mỵ Châu at the stream and frantically informs her. Mỵ Châu instructs two of the women to find and alert Trọng Thủy, who is downriver with four companions, while she and the rest head back towards the orphanage. Mỵ Châu picks up a crossbow within the hut and, along with Ly and Cậu, follows the tracks in the grass. Once they’ve caught up to the kidnappers, Mỵ Châu, realizing the numbers were against her, attempts to stall for time by aiming her crossbow at the men and yelling her demands for the release of the girls. She, in her mind, prays that Trọng Thủy would make it to her in time. And it certainly doesn’t help that the wind would throw her accuracy off. The kidnappers stop and turn around. While normally they would continue running, 7 men against 2 women and an old man seemed like an obvious choice. With two of the men holding onto the girls, the other five reveal their bronze short swords and axes and begin to surround Mỵ Châu and her entourage.
