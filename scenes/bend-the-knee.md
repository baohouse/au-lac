# Diplomacy

Panyu, 196 BC

Liu Bang, now Emperor Gaozu, sent Lu Jia to Nanyue in hopes of obtaining Zhao Tuo's allegiance. After arriving, Lu met with Zhao Tuo and is said to have found him dressed in Yue clothing and being greeted after their customs, which enraged him. A long exchange ensued, wherein Lu is said to have admonished Zhao Tuo, pointing out that he was Chinese, not Yue, and should have maintained the dress and decorum of the Chinese and not have forgotten the traditions of his ancestors. Lu lauded the strength of the Han court and warned against a kingdom as small as Nanyue daring to oppose it. He further threatened to kill Zhao's kinsmen in China proper and destroying their ancestral graveyards, as well as coercing the Yue into deposing Zhao himself. Following the threat, Zhao Tuo then decided to receive Emperor Gaozu's seal and submit to Han authority. Trade relations were established at the border between Nanyue and the Han city of Changsha.

# Master and Student

Co Loa, 196 BC

Lac resistance members who oppose Thuc Phan kidnap My Ha. They would have also kidnapped My Chau, had Qúy An not intervene. He laments that he knows one of them, and explains to Thuc Phan that they are children of loyalists to the previous Hùng King. He doesn't understand why they continue to wage a fight that is not theirs, but instead belongs to their parents. Thuc Phan assembles a search party. As he sends them off, he thanks Qúy An for having saved My Chau, but reminds him that this does not mean he is indebted. Maybe, he might consider being indebted if he trains My Chau in the ways of the warrior. My Chau, who loves her sister, grows worried. She resists the idea of training as a warrior so soon after the incident. But Qúy An explains to her, in a rather untactful manner, that My Chau was not strong enough to protect her sister, and that if My Chau cannot defend herself, she could become kidnapped like her sister. My Chau musters up strength, stokes the fires of anger, and agrees to become his student.

# Reign of the Empress Dowager

Han capital, 195 BC

After the funeral of the first Han emperor, a coronation ceremony is given for Liu Ying. After the ceremony, Empress Dowager Lü Zhi asks to have a private conversation with her son, who is still sleeping in from last night, along with a number of maidens. They scurry out of the room and bow to Lü Zhi. She tells him he is to marry his niece, Zhang Yan. He tries to protest, but she strong-arms him. She names off all of the women, including the number of nights, with whom he has slept. Lü Zhi has eyes and ears everywhere, and if he so much as dare try to oppose her, she will gift him a necklace made of amputated fingers from all of those women. Liu Ying backs down in silence.

As they step back into the throne room, the mandarins lay out the agenda, including infrastructure projects (building more roads to all conquered lands) and foreign affairs; the northern borders with the Xiongnu peoples are still being pillaged, as are the southern borders against the Yue. Lü Zhi, annoyed, instructs the mandarins to invite the governor of Changsha to begin monitoring trade between the Han empire and the Yue states of the south. The mandarins beg forgiveness and ask if this is the will of the emperor. Liu Ying stammers and says the will of the empress dowager is the will of the emperor.

# Soul Twins

Outside of Panyu, 192 BC

Anticipating a threat from the Han, Zhao Tuo has increased recruitment and military training. At a training camp, a group of men visit the nearby town, where booze and prostitutes could be found. Feng, an exemplary soldier, is reluctant, but bends to peer pressure. He meets a particularly young addition to the group (she's only been doing this for a few weeks), Li. She attempts to seduce him, but he declines her advances. Li asks what's wrong, is she not pretty enough, or if he needs more drink. He asks her to swear secrecy and confesses that he isn't attracted to women. She asks if he's into men, and Feng neither confirms nor denies, leading her to believe that silence is confirmation. Feng asks if he can just camp out for a bit, and pretend that he had sex with her so that his fellow soldiers don't suspect anything. Li agrees, as long as she is compensated.

Feng asks where she's from, and she talks about a village about week southwest of Panyu. Feng says that means she's a Yue native, but he is surprised to see that she has more northern (Qin) features. She says it probably came from her father, likely a Qin soldier. She never knew who her father was; her mother said he came by one night and left the next morning, and within a few months, was pregnant. Her half-sibling's father was killed fighting the Qin, and they're also disgusted with her, being the daughter of a Qin enemy.

She asks where he's from. He says he was, from his earliest memories, practically born in the military. His mother was an army prostitute, and his father was a Qin soldier, from the area of Wei. He doesn't remember his mother, as she disowned him, while his father took on the task of raising Feng. As both Feng and Li are about the same age, where Feng does not know his mother, and Li not knowing her father, they begin to wonder if they are mirror-image twin souls. Li entertains a thought, wouldn't it be funny if they had the same father. Feng laughs, saying heaven has a horrible sense of humor. Feng kisses her on the forehead, and asks if it's alright to visit his 'little sister' again. Li says she might have to charge extra to play that role.

# New Neighbors

Panyu, 191 BC

Zhao Tuo receives a delegation from Dong'ou, a new kingdom north of Minyue. They discuss a stance of non-proliferation, and a mutual interest to keep the Minyue in check. Iron is an important resource; Zhao Tuo tries to play it off as necessary for agricultural equipment, but the Dong'ou delegation play hardball, saying it is also vital to their kingdom's interest. The face off ends in a stalemate; Zhao Tuo threatens to ignore Minyue aggression, and the Dong'ou threaten to withhold iron for trade. What they don't tell Zhao Tuo is that they procure most of the iron from the Han; their local production of iron is very limited.
