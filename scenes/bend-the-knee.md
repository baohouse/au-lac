* Diplomacy

Liu Bang, now Emperor Gaozu, sent Lu Jia to Nanyue in hopes of obtaining Zhao Tuo's allegiance. After arriving, Lu met with Zhao Tuo and is said to have found him dressed in Yue clothing and being greeted after their customs, which enraged him. A long exchange ensued, wherein Lu is said to have admonished Zhao Tuo, pointing out that he was Chinese, not Yue, and should have maintained the dress and decorum of the Chinese and not have forgotten the traditions of his ancestors. Lu lauded the strength of the Han court and warned against a kingdom as small as Nanyue daring to oppose it. He further threatened to kill Zhao's kinsmen in China proper and destroying their ancestral graveyards, as well as coercing the Yue into deposing Zhao himself. Following the threat, Zhao Tuo then decided to receive Emperor Gaozu's seal and submit to Han authority. Trade relations were established at the border between Nanyue and the Han city of Changsha.

* Master and Student (around the same time as "Diplomacy")

Lac resistance members who oppose Thuc Phan kidnap My Ha. They would have also kidnapped My Chau, had Qúy An not intervene. He laments that he knows one of them, and explains to Thuc Phan that they are children of loyalists to the previous Hùng King. He doesn't understand why they continue to wage a fight that is not theirs, but instead belongs to their parents. Thuc Phan assembles a search party. As he sends them off, he thanks Qúy An for having saved My Chau, but reminds him that this does not mean he is indebted. Maybe, he might consider being indebted if he trains My Chau in the ways of the warrior. My Chau, who loves her sister, grows worried. She resists the idea of training as a warrior so soon after the incident. But Qúy An explains to her, in a rather untactful manner, that My Chau was not strong enough to protect her sister, and that if My Chau can not defend herself, she could become kidnapped like her sister. My Chau musters up strength, stokes the fires of anger, and agrees to become his student.

* Reign of the Empress Dowager

After the funeral of the first Han emperor, a coronation ceremony is given for Liu Ying. After the ceremony, Empress Dowager Lü Zhi have a private conversation. She tells him he is to marry his niece. He tries to protest, but she strong-arms him. She names off all of the women, including the number of nights, with whom he has slept. Lü Zhi has eyes and ears everywhere, and if he so much as dare try to oppose her, she will gift him a necklace made of amputated fingers from all of those women. Liu Ying backs down in silence.

* Military Buildup

Anticipating a threat from the Han, Zhao Tuo increases recruitment and military training.

* New Neighbors

Zhao Tuo receives a delegation from Dong'ou, a new kingdom north of Minyue. They discuss a stance of non-proliferation, and a mutural interest to keep the Minyue in check. Iron is an important resource; Zhao Tuo tries to play it off as necessary for agricultural equipment, but the Dong'ou delegation play hardball, saying it is also vital to their kingdom's interest. The face off ends in a stalemate; Zhao Tuo threatens to ignore Minyue aggression, and the Dong'ou threaten to withhold iron for trade. What they don't tell Zhao Tuo is that they procure most of the iron from the Han; their local production of iron is very limited.
